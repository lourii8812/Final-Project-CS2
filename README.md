# INTRODUCTION
Weather affects our daily activities, but raw weather data can be hard to understand. This project aims to create a Python program that reads and analyzes weather information from a JSON file. It will help users easily view important details like temperature, rainfall, humidity, and weather conditions, allowing them to observe patterns and make better decisions based on the weekâ€™s weather.
